This project is the **client** of Fashion Shop project. It is built with ReactJS, Redux. I consume the RestAPI built by my own with Django framework

In this project, I use as few libraries as possible. All things such as form validation, slides, pagination are built from scratch.

The backend is stored in [the repo](https://github.com/huubinh49/fashion_shop_BE)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
